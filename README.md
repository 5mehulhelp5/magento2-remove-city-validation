# elgentos/magento2-improved-customer-address-validation

The validation for customer addresses has been updated in Magento 2.4.8, and not for the better.

With this extension, you have finer control over the validation of the Name, City, Street and Telephone fields on the customer address entity.

You can find the configuration under Stores > Configuration > Customer > Customer Configuration > Name and Address Options;
